Hi there! 👋 I'm Zarin Tasnim Mishu, 
I decided to start learning programming and data science to combine my background in agriculture with the power of data. My goal is to understand how data can solve problems, improve decision-making, and bring innovation to industries like agriculture, economics, finance and beyond.
🌱 My Journey So Far: I'm a beginner in coding, so I'm learning from scratch.
